# Table

An UI element which organizes data into rows and columns.

Syntax:

```xml
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>...</th>
            <th>...</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

A table has a head (`thead`) and a body (`tbody`).

The head includes the column cells (`th`) , whilst the body includes the data cells (`td`).

Each `tr` element represents a row.

The `...` includes textual content.

So here, we have a table with:

- One row of two column cells.
- One row of two data cells.
