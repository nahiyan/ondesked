# About

Ondesked is a markup language which is used for developing GUI for desktop apps.

It's based on XML, and is similar to HTML; if you know HTML, you already know some of Ondesked.

Every Ondesked document should have an `app` element as the root element. Just like this:

```xml
<app>...</app>
```
