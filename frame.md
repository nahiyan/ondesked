# Frame

A frame is pretty much a general window, much like the browser window you're reading this on right now.

Frames must go inside `app` tags. Here's the basic syntax:

```markup
<frame>...</frame>
```

Attributes:

* `title` Title of the frame.

Classes:

* `centered` Center the frame in the screen.
* `visible` Make the frame visible.
