# App

App, as the name explains, represents the app that you're building.

As mentioned in the [previous page](https://nahiyan.gitbook.io/ondesked/about), the `app` element should be at the root of the document.

Syntax:

```markup
<app>...</app>
```

Attributes:

* `id` Identifier of the app, extremely important even if it may not seem to be doing much.
